# SampleProject
A tiny game program created in C++ and SDL2

This project was developed in Visual Studio 2019 Community.
To compile, the IDE may be needed.
You may need development environment settings to compile and link program.
If so, I want you to see a web site for SDL2 settings.
e.g.
[Example1](https://tmick.net/gamedev-vs2017-sdl/),
[Example2](https://www.kuroshum.com/entry/2019/07/18/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0C++%E3%81%AE%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E6%A7%8B%E7%AF%89(SDL)#%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%81%AE%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A).
This is Japanese web sites. 

SDL2 libraries used in this program are "SDL2.lib","SDL2main.lib","SDL2_image.lib","SDL2_ttf.lib","SDL2_mixer.lib".
When you link these libs, perhaps this program can work.
At least, it worked on my PC.

# Operation examination and Battle rule
W key and S key : To move the cursor.
Space key : To decide.

Battle rule is simple. Attack and defeat a enemy. If you hit weakness of the enemy, enemy's attack speed become slow, and vice versa.
