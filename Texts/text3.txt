The knight killed him.
Even if you killed me,
Thousands of my servants will kill you.
When he said so, he died.
Taking a breath, the knight hear sounds.
Sounds that metal rubs.
They can be heard from all directions.
Thousands of servents surrounded the knight,
And sticked out spears.
He struggled lonely,
And slashed hundreds of servants.
But, it's time to finish.
The knight was pierced backward,
Vomited blood and collapsed. 
So...
The knight died easily.
